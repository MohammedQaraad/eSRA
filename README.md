Abstract 
This study introduces a new optimization algorithm, the Enhanced Schrödinger Optimization Algorithm (eSRA), designed to improve the performance of machine learning models in complex, high-dimensional problems. The eSRA integrates adaptive parameter control, elite archive management, and stagnation-recovery mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during optimization. To evaluate its effectiveness, eSRA was tested against several well-known algorithms and applied to a real-world biomedical problem—gene expression classification in Wilms tumor (WT). A combination of microarray (GSE66405, GSE73209, GSE2712, GSE11024) and RNA-seq (TARGET-WT) datasets was used, totaling over 260 samples from tumor and normal kidney tissues. The eSRA was employed to optimize both gene subset selection and the hyperparameters of an XGBoost classifier. Experimental results showed that eSRA achieved the highest accuracy (97.8%), F1 score (0.988), and ROC AUC (0.998), outperforming traditional and hybrid optimization algorithms. The model remained stable across population sizes and dimensions, demonstrating its scalability and robustness. Interpretability analysis using SHAP values revealed key genes—such as SCG5, CCND2, SOX11, VWF, and SIX1—as major contributors to tumor classification. Functional enrichment confirmed that these genes are involved in cell proliferation, embryonic kidney development, and vascular remodeling, processes central to Wilms tumor biology. Overall, this work shows that eSRA is a powerful, efficient optimizer that enhances machine learning performance and provides biologically meaningful insights, making it a promising tool for biomedical data analysis and cancer genomics research.
